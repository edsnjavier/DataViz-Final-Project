# Salary Prediction Model for IT Professionals

## Description
Developed a salary prediction model for IT professionals, analyzing factors like experience, specialization, skill set, and location, with 85% accuracy using linear regression. As the team member in charge of visualizations and documentation, I created heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar graphs to illustrate insights. Key steps included data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and analysis, ensuring accurate predictions. The project supports salary negotiations, career planning, and competitive compensation strategies.
